        **NB** TopoStats `< 2.0.0` is no longer actively maintained. If you have encountered an issue using this deprecated  version please try TopoStats `>= 2.0.0`, there are instructions on installation, usage and configuration at...

        + [Installation](https://afm-spm.github.io/TopoStats/installation.html)
        + [Usage](https://afm-spm.github.io/TopoStats/usage.html)
        + [Configuration](https://afm-spm.github.io/TopoStats/configuration.html)

        By default TopoStats will process images in parallel to speed up processing. In order to identify the problematic image you should re-run your analyses using the `--cores 1` option so that images are processed sequentially. This makes it possible to identify which image causes the problem.
