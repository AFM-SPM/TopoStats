# The following section defines a dictionary where they key is the name of the image generated by
# Filters/Grains/Grainstats and the value is a nested dictionary with the following keys/values.
#
# Generally you should NOT need to change any of these unless you explicitly want to and even then you may wish to
# consider instead running the analysis in a Jupyter Notebook and configuring your plotting options there.
#
# | Key          | Type    |Description                                                                   |
# |--------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
# | filename     | String  | Filename (minus extension) to which image is saved.                          |
# | title        | String  | Title for the plot                                                           |
# | image_type         | String  | Whether the plot includes the height (non-binary) or the outline (binary)    |
# | core_set     | Boolean | Whether a plot is considered part of the core set of images that are plotted.|
