Grain Finding:
  # Blur amount
  gaussian_size : 2
  # Sets the rms multiplier for high-value outlier detection. Higher : Less sensitive to outliers
  upper_height_threshold_rms_multiplier : 1
  # Otsu threshold multiplier for lower thresholding the data. Higher : Culls lower values around the edges of grains
  lower_threshold_otsu_multiplier : 1.7
  # Minimum grain size in nm. Set to -1 to let the software auto detect based on the median size.
  minimum_grain_size_nm : -1
