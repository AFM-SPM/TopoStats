# Configuration

Configuration for TopoStats is done using a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) configuration file that is specified on the
command line when invoking. The current configuration file is provided in the TopoStats repository at
[`topostats/default_config.yaml`](https://github.com/AFM-SPM/TopoStats/blob/main/topostats/default_config.yaml) but
please be aware this may not work with your installed version, particularly if you installed from PyPI.

## Generating a configuration

You can always generate a configuration file appropriate for the version you have installed (bar v2.0.0 as this option
was added afterwards). This writes the default configuration to the specified filename (i.e. it does not have to be
called `config.yaml` it could be called `spm-2023-02-20.yaml`)

``` bash
run_topostats --create-config-file config.yaml
```

If no configuration file is provided this default configuration is loaded automatically and used.

## Using a custom configuration

If you have generated a configuration file you can modify and edit a configuration it to change the parameters (see
fields below). Once these changes have been saved, you can run TopoStats with this configuration file as shown below.

``` bash
run_topostats --config my_config.yaml
```

On completion a copy of the configuration that was used is written to the output directory so you have a record of the
parameters used to generate the results you have. This file can be used in subsequent runs of TopoStats.

## YAML Structure

YAML files have key and value pairs, the first word, e.g. `base_dir` is the key this is followed by a colon to separate
it from the value that it takes, by default `base_dir` takes the value `./` (which means the current directory) and so
the entry in the file is a single line with `base_dir: ./`. Other data structures are available in YAML files including
nested values and lists.

A list in YAML consists of a key (e.g. `above:`) followed by the values in square brackets separated by commas such as
`above: [ 500, 800 ]`. This means the `above` key is a list of the values `500` and `800`. Long lists can be split over
separate lines as shown below

``` yaml
above:
  - 100
  - 200
  - 300
  - 400
```

## Fields

Aside from the comments in YAML file itself the fields are described below.

## Summary Configuration

Plots summarising the distribution of metrics are generated by default. The behaviour is controlled by a configuration
file. The default example can be found in `topostats/summary_config.yaml`. The fields of this file are described below.

## Validation

Configuration files are validated against a schema to check that the values in the configuration file are within the
expected ranges or valid parameters. This helps capture problems early and should provide informative messages as to
what needs correcting if there are errors.

[^1] When writing file paths you can use absolute or relative paths. On Windows systems absolute paths start with the
drive letter (e.g. `c:/`) on Linux and OSX systems they start with `/`. Relative paths are started either with a `./`
which denotes the current directory or one or more `../` which means the higher level directory from the current
directory. You can always find the current directory you are in using the `pwd` (`p`rint `w`orking `d`irectory). If
your work is in `/home/user/path/to/my/data` and `pwd` prints `/home/user` then the relative path to your data is
`./path/to/my/data`. The `cd` command is used to `c`hange `d`irectory.

``` bash
pwd
/home/user/
# Two ways of changing directory using a relative path
cd ./path/to/my/data
pwd
/home/user/path/to/my/data
# Using an absolute path
cd /home/user/path/to/my/data
pwd
/home/user/path/to/my/data
```
