## General Questions

### My files image files are on a mounted Google Drive, can I process them there?

Maybe! We have had mixed success with processing images that are located on Google Drive and mounted on your local
computer.
If you find you are encountering errors such as `FileExistsError` (see
[#201](https://github.com/AFM-SPM/TopoStats/issues/201)) then please copy your files to a local drive on your computer
for processing and then copy the results back to the network drive.
