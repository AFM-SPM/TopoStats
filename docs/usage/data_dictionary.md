# Data Dictionary

Output from TopoStats includes two sets of statistics in ASCII text `.csv` files. The tables below detail the columns of
these files, the data types, a description and their units where appropriate.

## `all_statistics.csv`

The `all_statistics.csv` file contains details on each grain that has been detected and traced and has the following fields.
