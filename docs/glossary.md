where columns of data are separated by commas.

## D

### DNA

[Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) is a double-helix polymer of four molecules Cytosine,
Guanine, Adenine and Thymine. It is the genetic material of the vast majority of organisms (some viruses use
[Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA) as their genetic material).

### flattening

The process of removing [tilt](glossary.md#tilt) from an image.

### GitHub

[GitHub](https://www.github.com) is a website for sharing and collaboratively working on software that is version

### scars

Artefacts seen in some scans that can be removed during processing. Typically they appear as horizontal high
bands. These are removed and the missing values interpolated.

### skeleton

The single-pixel width outline of a molecule after a [grain](glossary.md#grain) has undergone [tracing](glossary.md#tracing).

## T

### tilt

### tracing

The processing step where by a [grain](glossary.md#grain) is reduced to a single pixel or skeleton. Typically a number of
statistics on the shape, length and curvature are calculated after molecules have been traced.
