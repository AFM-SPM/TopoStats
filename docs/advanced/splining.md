# Splining

This section gives an in-depth overview of the steps taken in the splining module.

## At a Glance : Smoothing Pixelated Traces

The `splining.py` module handles all the functions associated with smoothing the ordered pixel-wise trace from the
"ordered_tracing" step, in order to produce curves which more closely follow the samples structure.

The quality of the resultant metrics and smoothed coordinates will depend on the splining method chosen, whether the
ordering worked successfully, and whether the skeleton matches the underlying sample conformation.

This smooths the ordered trace by using an average of splines through the ordered coordinates (`spline` method) or using
the mean coordinate of a rolling window (`rolling_window` method), helping to resolve length errors in jagged in the
skeletons. It adds the contour length and end-to-end euclidean distance to the `all_mol_statistics.csv` and the sum and
average of these respectively to the `all_statistics.csv`.

Some quick FYI's:

- **Constricted Traces** - Using the `rolling_window` method with a rolling window size that is not far below the
  persistence length can result in over-smoothing where the spline is dragged away from regions of high curvature.
- **Unrepresentative Splines** - The `spline` method's parameters can be quite temperamental so it's recommended that
  `spline_linear_smoothing`, `spline_circular_smoothing` and `spline_degree` are not changed unless understood.
- **Unrepresentative Splines 2** - The `spline` method may produce unwanted results if the `spline_step_size` is too
  long. This is because the way the splines are averaged assumes that each spline point is sampled close to that of
  another's.

## Processing Steps

### Splining Method

#### 1. Trace Coordinate Subsets

The first stage is to use the ordered coordinates and the `spline_step_size` parameter to define how many splines we
want to average together. As the `spline_step_size` is the distance (in nm) at which to take every i'th coordinate for
its spline. This means the number of splines to average is calculated below:

$$ N = max(\text{spline step size} \div \text{px to nm}, 1) $$

The coordinates used for each spline are then obtained from the initial ordered trace, i.e. the spline coordinate
indexes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4], where spline 1 takes every 4th coordinate, starting at position 0, then
spline 2 takes every 4th coordinate starting at position 1, etc.

#### 2. Obtaining Splines

For each of these coordinate subsets, we use the
[Sci-Py](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.splprep.html#scipy.interpolate.splprep)
library to find the B-Spline representation of the 2D curve using the smoothness parameters `spline_linear_smoothing`,
`spline_circular_smoothing`, and the `spline_degree`, found in the configuration file. The `spline_linear_smoothing` and
`spline_circular_smoothing` define the degrees of smoothing for circular or linear molecules obtained in the Ordered
Tracing step, which also tells TopoStats whether to make the spline periodic if circular. Larger smoothing values mean
more smoothing and smaller values indicate less smoothing. The `spline_degree` should take odd values, or even with
large smoothing. Read more on the Sci-Py documentation above.

These splines are then averaged together via their index i.e. first spline coordinates are averaged, then second
etc... until a single averaged B-Spline remain. However, because the splined are averaged on their index, it is assumed
that each index is within close proximity, thus, the `spline_step_size` must be small enough for this assumption to hold
true and for the splining to work as intended.

### Rolling Window Method

#### 1. Rolling Average

This method simply uses a rolling average of the ordered trace coordinates within the `rolling_window_size` to produce
the new smoothed trace. The rolling window will move one coordinate along each time, and continues until the start of
the window returns back to its initial position.

![schematic of rolling window averaging](../_static/images/splining/rw_schematic.png)

For linear smooth traces, the same as above occurs however, the initial and final coordinates are also added to the
smoothed trace as to not drastically reduce the length of the smoothed trace.

## Outputs

The `<image>_<threshold>_ordered_traces` image shows the direction of ordered coordinates.

For each grain, the following new columns are added to the `grainstats.csv` file:

| Column Name                   | Description                                                                               | Data Type |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `total_contour_length`        | The total length along the splined trace of all identified molecules.                     | `float`   |
| `average_end_to_end_distance` | The average distance from two endpoints of the spline of all identified linear molecules. | `float`   |

For each molecule found by the ordering algorithm(s), the following new columns are added to the `molstats.csv` file:

| Column Name           | Description                                                           | Data Type |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `contour_length`      | The length along the splined trace of the molecule.                   | `float`   |
| `end_to_end_distance` | The distance from two endpoints of the spline of the linear molecule. | `float`   |

Note: Most information obtained during the Splining processing can be obtained from the `<image_name>.topostats` file
found within the `processed` folder and contains a multitude of molecule related objects such as:

- bounding box
- spline coordinates
- tracing statistics of contour length and end to end distance

## Diagnostic Images

There are no diagnostic images produced in this step.

## Possible Uses

This module would lend itself useful for accurately measuring the lengths of complex objects within samples, and
obtaining an accurate representation of the underlying conformation of the sample.

We have used this module to accurately measure the length of topologically complex DNA samples such as knots, catenanes,
and theata-curves (replication intermediates). Additionally, we've used the end-to-end distance to measure the
conformational variation of linear DNA in the presence of NDP-52 to show that it may also play a role in topological
regulation. [See more here.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38572-9).
