    #TopoStats - grain stats walkthrough
    This marimo notebook will walk you through using TopoStats from processing an AFM image through to quantification and data visualisation.

    There are several different ways of installing TopoStats depending on your usage. The simplest is to install from PyPi under a virtual environment:

    ```
    pip install topostats
    ```

    or you could install directly from the TopoStats GitHub repository to access all of the latest features:

    ```
    pip install git+https://github.com/AFM-SPM/TopoStats.git@main
    ```

    For more information on installing TopoStats and setting up virtual environments, please refer to our installation instructions [here]([https://link-url-here.org](https://afm-spm.github.io/TopoStats/main/installation.html)).

    ##Loading a configuration file

    You can specify all options explicitly by hand when instantiating classes or calling methods/functions. However when run
    at the command line in batch mode TopoStats loads these options from a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) configuration file and it is worth
    understanding the structure of this file and how it is used.

    A trimmed version is shown below. The words that come before the colon `:` are the option, e.g. `file_ext:` is the file extension of the AFM files to be processed, what comes after is the value, in this case `.spm`.

    Now that we have loaded some images, we can start processing using TopoStats. The first step is called filtering, and involves a sequence of processing steps to remove noise and AFM-specific imaging artifacts. There are a number of options that we need to specify to optimise filtering, and these are described in detail in the TopoStats [documentation](https://topostats.readthedocs.io/en/dev/topostats.filters.html).

    Once we setup a `Filters` object we can call the different methods that are available for it. There are lots of
    different methods that carry out the different steps but for convenience the `filter_image()` method runs all these.

    So far the thresholding method used has been `threshold_method="std_dev"` defined in the configuration file we
    loaded. This calculates the mean and standard deviation of height across the whole image and then determines the threshold by scaling the standard deviation by a given factor (defined by `threshold_std_dev`) and adding it to the mean to give the `above` threshold and/or subtracting if from the mean to give the `below` threshold.

    We could instead use `threshold_method="absolute"`. Absolute thresholding is a simple method of thresholding that uses a user-defined threshold value to separate the foreground and background pixels. This method is useful when you know the exact threshold value you want to use, for example if you know your DNA lies at 2nm above the surface you can set the threshold to 1.5nm to capture the DNA without capturing the background. Here we explicitly state the `below` and `above` height thresholds (although since we are only looking for objects above a given threshold only the `above` value will be used).

    Other thresholding methods that can be used within TopoStats are described in the documentation [here]("https://github.com/AFM-SPM/TopoStats/blob/main/docs/advanced/thresholding.md").

    ##Extracting grain statistics
    Now that the grains have been found we can calculate statistics for each. This is done using the `GrainStats()`
    class. Again the configuration options from the YAML file map to those of the class and there is a convenience method
    `calculate_stats()` which will run all steps of grain stats.

    For details of what the arguments are please refer to the [API
    reference](https://afm-spm.github.io/TopoStats/topostats.grainstats.html).

    The `GrainStats` class returns two objects, a Pandas `pd.DataFrame` of calculated statistics and a `list` of
    dictionaries containing the grain data to be plotted. We therefore instantiate ("set-up") the `grain_stats` dictionary
    to hold these results and unpack each to the keys `statistics` and `plots` respectively.
