An AFM image analysis program to batch process data and obtain statistics from images.

## How to Use

There is more complete documentation on the projects documentation website. This is hosted in two locations.

* [GitHub Pages : TopoStats](https://afm-spm.github.io/TopoStats/)
* [Readthedocs : TopoStats](https://topostats.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)

### Installation

TopoStats is available via PyPI and can be installed in your Virtual Environment with...

``` bash
pip install topostats
```

For more on installation please see the [installation instructions](https://afm-spm.github.io/TopoStats/installation.html)

### Tutorials and Examples

For a full description of usage please refer to the [usage](https://afm-spm.github.io/TopoStats/usage.html) documentation.

A default configuration is loaded automatically and so the simplest method of processing images is to run
`run_topostats` in the same directory as your scans _after_ having activated the virtual environment in which you have
installed TopoStats

``` bash
run_topostats
```

If you have your own YAML configuration file (see [Usage : Configuring
TopoStats](https://afm-spm.github.io/TopoStats/usage.html#configuring_topostats)) then invoke `run_topostats` and use
the argument for `--config <config_file>.yaml` that points to your file.

``` bash
# Edit and save my_config.yaml then run TopoStats with this configuration file
run_topostats --config my_config.yaml
```

The configuration file is validated before analysis begins and if there are problems you will see errors messages that
are hopefully useful in resolving the error(s) in your modified configuration.
