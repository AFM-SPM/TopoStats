--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An AFM image analysis program to batch process data and obtain statistics from images.

There is more complete documentation on the projects [documentation website](https://afm-spm.github.io/TopoStats/).

## Installation

TopoStats is available via PyPI and can be installed in your Virtual Environment with...

``` bash
pip install topostats
```

For more on installation and how to upgrade please see the [installation
instructions](https://afm-spm.github.io/TopoStats/main/installation.html).

## How to Use

### Tutorials and Examples

For a full description of usage please refer to the [usage](https://afm-spm.github.io/TopoStats/main/usage.html) documentation.

A default configuration is loaded automatically and so the simplest method of processing images is to run
`run_topostats` in the same directory as your scans _after_ having activated the virtual environment in which you have
installed TopoStats

``` bash
run_topostats
```

If you have your own YAML configuration file (see [Usage : Configuring
TopoStats](https://afm-spm.github.io/TopoStats/main/usage.html#configuring_topostats)) then invoke `run_topostats` and use
the argument for `--config <config_file>.yaml` that points to your file.

``` bash
# Edit and save my_config.yaml then run TopoStats with this configuration file
run_topostats --config my_config.yaml
```

The configuration file is validated before analysis begins and if there are problems you will see errors messages that
are hopefully useful in resolving the error(s) in your modified configuration.

You can generate a sample configuration file using the `--create-config-file` argument which takes a single argument,
the name of the file to save the configuration to (e.g. `config.yaml` or `settings.yaml`). This will _not_  run any
analyses but will instead write the default configuration to the file `config.yaml` in the current directory.

**NB** - This feature is only available in versions > v2.0.0 as it was introduced after v2.0.0 was released.

``` bash
run_topostats --create-config-file config.yaml
```

### Notebooks

Example Jupyter Notebooks are in have been developed that show how to use TopoStats package interactively which is
useful when you are unsure of what parameters are most suited to your scans.  Other notebooks exist which show how to
produce plots of the summary grain and tracing statistics or how to generate plots of scans from processed images which
saves having to run the processing again. See the documentation on
[Notebooks](https://afm-spm.github.io/TopoStats/main/notebooks.html) for further details.
